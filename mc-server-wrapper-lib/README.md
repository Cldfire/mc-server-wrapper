# mc-server-wrapper-lib

Rust library that handles communicating with a Java Minecraft server (vanilla, Spigot, or PaperSpigot), allowing you to send commands and receive events via channels.

This library is currently heavily WIP and in the process of being designed. Documentation and examples will be added in the future.
