## [alpha4] - 2020-12-20

### Added

* Mentions within Discord are now formatted with a blue color in Minecraft (similar to how they look in the Discord client)
* Hovering over the username part of a Discord message in Minecraft will now reveal the Discord user's account name and discriminator (e.g. Cldfire#3395)
  * Also displayed when hovering over user mentions
  * This information is now logged as well

### Changed

### Added

* The UI now has a "Players" tab to display information about players on the server

### Changed

* We no longer attempt to fetch missing member info via Discord's HTTP API if it is not present in the cache ([explanation](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight/pull/437))
  * This should not have any user-facing impact because technically speaking all needed info will be present in the cache anyway
* The config that gets generated by default now includes a blank `[discord]` section for easier Discord bridge setup
