## [alpha4] - 2020-12-20

### Added

* Mentions within Discord are now formatted with a blue color in Minecraft (similar to how they look in the Discord client)
* Hovering over the username part of a Discord message in Minecraft will now reveal the Discord user's account name and discriminator (e.g. Cldfire#3395)
  * Also displayed when hovering over user mentions
  * This information is now logged as well

### Changed

* `Tab` / `Shift + Tab` are now the shortcuts used to change tabs in the UI

### Fixed

### Internal

* Removed dependency on `ringbuffer` (using `VecDeque` instead)

## [alpha3] - 2020-12-15

### Added

* The UI now has a "Players" tab to display information about players on the server
  * Displays a list of online players with login time and session length

### Changed

* We no longer attempt to fetch missing member info via Discord's HTTP API if it is not present in the cache ([explanation](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight/pull/437))
  * This should not have any user-facing impact because technically speaking all needed info will be present in the cache anyway
* The config that gets generated by default now includes a blank `[discord]` section for easier Discord bridge setup

### Fixed

* Minecraft player names are no longer markdown-sanitized for display in the bot status (the bot status message doesn't support markdown)

  * Daily audit job is now a weekly audit job

* Content that failed to validate will now be logged alongside the warning that a message failed to send to Discord
